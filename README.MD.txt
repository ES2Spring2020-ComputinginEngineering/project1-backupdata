Some example data from a pendulum of 5 lengths (roughly 34, 43, 53, 62, and 72 centimeters) measured from the pivot point to the top of the micro:bit).

Data recorded as: time in ms, xaccel in m-g, yaccel in m-g, and zaccel in m-g for each length.

Some started analysis code which parses csv files, crops to a clean data section, fixes units, calculates theta, applys a filter, and graphs.
